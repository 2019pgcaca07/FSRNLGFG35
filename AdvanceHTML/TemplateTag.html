<!-- Explanation :

    The html code defines a template element with the ID myTemplate. 
    This template element contains a heading element (<h2>) with the text "Hello World", and a 
    paragraph element (<p>) with the text "This is a pg".
    In the JavaScript code, a constant named data is defined with two properties: title and description.
    Then, the template element is retrieved using the getElementById method and stored in the template constant. 
    The content of the template element is then cloned using the cloneNode method with the true argument to make 
    a deep copy. This creates a new document fragment that is an exact copy of the template's content.
    The querySelector method is used to select the h2 and p elements within the cloned content. 
    The innerHTML property of these elements is then set to the corresponding values of the data object.
    Finally, the modified content is appended to the body element using the appendChild method, effectively adding
     the template to the DOM. -->
